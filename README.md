# tinFOIlhat

This is an app to collect responses from the disclosure logs that some public bodies publish (and What Do They Know) and make that data available in a way that it can be searched and analysed. 

We previously had a web front end for the data - code for that is in [old](https://github.com/ormiret/tinfoil-hat/tree/old) branch.
